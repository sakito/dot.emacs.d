# This is an example of a project-specific .pycheckers file. Uncomment and
# modify any options that are required, rename to ".pycheckers", and place in
# the project root directory.

# By default, config files in parent directories are merged in, with lower
# (more-specific) files taking precedence. This allows you to specify overall
# options for a project, and a set of override options for a specific directory
# (e.g. for machine-generated files that should receive less-strict checking).

# Give this option to ignore a certain set of error/warning codes
# ignore_codes = C0411, C0413, C0103, C0111, W0142, W0201, W0232, W0403, W0511, E1002, E1101, E1103, R0201, R0801, R0903, R0904, R0914

# Specify this option if you have a specific virtualenv location

# Specify the maximum line length

# Custom checkers to run (overrides flycheck-pycheckers-checkers)
# checkers = pep8,mypy2,bandit,flake8

# Config file locations
